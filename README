RFID-Biblio

This is set of tools to use different RFID readers for library use.

Main idea is to develop simple API to reader, and than provide useful
abstractions on top of it to quickly write applications to respond on
tags which come in range of RFID reader.

scripts/RFID-JSONP-server.pl is example of such application. It's local
interface to RFID reader and JSONP REST server.

examples/koha-rfid.js is jQuery based JavaScript code which can be inserted
in Koha Library System to provide overlay with tags in range and check-in/check-out
form-fill functionality.

Currently supported readers:

 * 3M 810  - RFID::Biblio::3M810
 * CPR-M02 - RFID::Biblio::CPRM02
 * OpenPCD, The Omnikey CardMan 5121 and 5321 - RFID::Biblio::librfid

For status of each implementation see pod documentation inside them.
